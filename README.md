# Interactive Bar Graph using D3.js

## Summary
This program uses JSON data on a year of monthly expenses, and illustrates a bar graph, where each bar is a category based on the expense, for every month. The graph changes each second as a new month is reflected.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)

## Author

All code written by [Alex Rogers](https://github.com/alexrogers823 "Alex Rogers' GitHub page")

## Highlights
This code was presented at the [JavaScript Alpharetta](https://www.meetup.com/JavaScriptAlpharetta/ "JavaScript Alpharetta meetup page") meetup on October 24, 2018, in Alpharetta, GA. View the powerpoint and starter code [here](https://github.com/alexrogers823/alpharetta-js-d3-presentation/archive/start.zip).

## Purpose
After playing around with JavaScript for a few months, I found a blog that showed me the basics of D3 and how interactive it can become. Inspired, I built this graph in the summer of 2018 to expand my knowledge of D3.js and JavaScript as a whole.

#### Challenges
- Developing algorithm to make axis visible, and bars to iterate based on axis placement.
- Manipulating the asynchronous nature of JavaScript with promises. Some of my variables, as well as the categorical axis, relied on a resolved promise.

## Rebuild it yourself
- Beginner challenge: Go to the [starter code](https://github.com/alexrogers823/alpharetta-js-d3-presentation/archive/start.zip) and fill in the blanks to reconstruct the graph
- Intermediate challenge: Use your own set of data to reference in the graph
- Advanced challenge: Recreate the entire graph from scratch
